# Test Coverage Summary

## Test Files Created/Enhanced

This document summarizes the test coverage improvements made to supplement missing tests across the entire project.

### Platform Layer Tests
- `internal/platform/cache/cache_test.go` - Comprehensive tests for memory cache and no-op cache implementations
- `internal/platform/filesystem/filesystem_test.go` - Tests for both OS and memory filesystem implementations
- `internal/platform/commands/executor_test.go` - Tests for command execution with OS and mock implementations

### Core Infrastructure Tests
- `internal/core/types_test.go` - Tests for core types, constants, and mock filesystem implementations
- `internal/errors/errors_test.go` - Tests for custom error types and helper functions

### Health System Tests
- `internal/health/orchestration/engine_test.go` - Comprehensive tests for the orchestration engine
- `internal/health/checkers/base/checker_test.go` - Tests for base checker functionality and result builders
- `internal/health/analyzers/registry/registry_test.go` - Tests for analyzer registry management
- `internal/health/reporting/formatter_test.go` - Tests for result formatting and display

## Test Coverage Areas

### Completed âœ…
1. **Platform Infrastructure** - All packages have comprehensive test coverage
2. **Core Types and Interfaces** - Basic functionality tested
3. **Error Handling** - Custom errors and helpers tested
4. **Health Orchestration** - Engine workflow and concurrency tested
5. **Base Checker Framework** - Common checker functionality tested
6. **Registry Systems** - Analyzer and checker registries tested

### Partially Complete ðŸ”„
1. **Reporting System** - Basic structure tests (some display tests may need refinement due to color formatting)
2. **Health Checkers** - Base framework tested, specific checkers need individual tests

### Still Needed ðŸ“‹
1. **Individual Checker Tests** - Each specific checker (git, security, compliance, etc.)
2. **Analyzer Implementation Tests** - Language-specific analyzers (go, java, javascript, etc.)
3. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing for large repositories

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Mock Implementations**: Comprehensive mocks for interfaces to enable isolated testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests cover both success and failure paths
- **Edge Cases**: Empty inputs, invalid data, timeouts, and concurrency tested
- **Builder Patterns**: Fluent API testing for result builders
- **Interface Compliance**: All mocks implement required interfaces correctly

## Running Tests

To run all the new tests:
```bash
# Run all platform tests
go test ./internal/platform/...

# Run all health system tests  
go test ./internal/health/...

# Run core infrastructure tests
go test ./internal/core ./internal/errors

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/health/orchestration
go test ./internal/platform/cache
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Individual Checker Tests**: Create tests for each specific health checker
2. **Add Analyzer Tests**: Create tests for language-specific analyzers
3. **Integration Testing**: Add end-to-end workflow tests
4. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks and load tests
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Use `go test -cover` to measure test coverage percentage

## Technical Notes

- All tests use table-driven testing patterns where appropriate
- Mock implementations follow the same interfaces as production code
- Tests are focused on behavior verification rather than implementation details
- Error handling is thoroughly tested with expected error conditions
- Concurrency safety is tested where applicable (cache, orchestration engine)
