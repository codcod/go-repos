## Key Components

### 1. Core Domain (internal/core/)

**Purpose**: Defines the core domain types and interfaces that all other components depend on.

**Key Files**:
- `types.go`: Domain models (Repository, CheckResult, Issue, etc.)
- `interfaces.go`: Core interfaces (Checker, Analyzer, Reporter, etc.)

**Benefits**:
- Clear contract definitions
- Type safety across components
- Single source of truth for domain models

### 2. Base Checker Framework (internal/checkers/base/)

**Purpose**: Provides common functionality for all health checkers.

**Key Features**:
- Common execution patterns
- Error handling
- Result building
- Timeout management
- Status calculation

**Example Usage**:
```go
type MyChecker struct {
    *base.BaseChecker
}

func (c *MyChecker) Check(ctx context.Context, repoCtx core.RepositoryContext) (core.CheckResult, error) {
    return c.Execute(ctx, repoCtx, func() (core.CheckResult, error) {
        // Actual check logic here
        builder := base.NewResultBuilder(c.ID(), c.Name(), c.Category())
        // Build result...
        return builder.Build(), nil
    })
}
```

### 3. Language Analyzer Registry (internal/analyzers/registry/)

**Purpose**: Manages language-specific analyzers and provides discovery mechanisms.

**Key Features**:
- Analyzer registration and discovery
- Language detection based on file extensions
- Repository analysis coordination

**Example Usage**:
```go
registry := registry.NewRegistry()
registry.Register(NewGoAnalyzer())
registry.Register(NewPythonAnalyzer())

analyzers := registry.GetSupportedAnalyzers(repository)
```

### 4. Specialized Checkers (internal/checkers/quality/complexity/)

**Purpose**: Implements specific health checks with clear separation of concerns.

**Key Features**:
- Domain-specific logic
- Configurable thresholds
- Detailed reporting
- Integration with analyzer registry

### 5. Platform Abstraction (internal/platform/)

**Purpose**: Abstracts platform-specific operations for better testability.

**Key Features**:
- File system operations
- Command execution
- Caching
- Multiple implementations (OS, memory, mock)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Gradual Interface Introduction

1. **Introduce Core Interfaces**: Start by defining core interfaces in `internal/core/`
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Create adapters for existing checkers to implement new interfaces
3. **Parallel Implementation**: Run both old and new systems in parallel

### Step 2: Extract Language Analyzers

1. **Create Base Analyzer**: Extract common analysis logic
2. **Language-Specific Implementations**: Move language-specific code to dedicated analyzers
3. **Registry Pattern**: Implement analyzer registry for discovery

### Step 3: Modularize Checkers

1. **Base Checker**: Create base checker with common functionality
2. **Category Separation**: Move checkers to category-specific packages
3. **Configuration Integration**: Integrate with new configuration system

### Step 4: Platform Abstraction

1. **File System**: Abstract file operations
2. **Command Execution**: Abstract command execution
3. **Testing**: Create mock implementations for testing

### Step 5: Orchestration Layer

1. **Execution Engine**: Create orchestration engine
2. **Pipeline Processing**: Implement processing pipelines
3. **Parallel Execution**: Add parallel execution capabilities

```

## Testing Strategy

- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior can be modified without code changes
- **Registry Pattern**: Dynamic discovery and registration

### 3. Testability
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies are injected through interfaces
- **Mock Implementations**: Platform abstractions enable comprehensive testing
- **Isolated Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation

### 4. Maintainability
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined package boundaries
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code through clear interfaces

### 5. Performance
