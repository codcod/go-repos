# Migration Summary: Homegrown to semantic-release

> **Overview**: This is a high-level summary of our semantic release migration. For technical details, see [Semantic Release Migration Guide](02_semantic_release.md).

## ‚úÖ Migration Complete

The migration from the homegrown semantic release solution to the official [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) project has been successfully completed.

## üîÑ What Was Changed

### Files Added
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies for semantic-release
- `.releaserc.json` - semantic-release configuration
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Auto-generated changelog (managed by semantic-release)
- `scripts/test-release.sh` - Local testing and validation script
- `docs/SEMANTIC_RELEASE.md` - Complete migration documentation

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/release.yaml` - Completely rewritten to use semantic-release
- `cmd/repos/main.go` - Version info now uses environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- `Makefile` - Added support for version injection via environment variables
- `README.md` - Added commit message convention documentation
- `.gitignore` - Added `node_modules/` exclusion

### Files Removed
- ‚ùå No files removed (old workflow was replaced)

## üÜö Before vs After

### Before (Homegrown)
```yaml
# Complex custom logic with 150+ lines
- Manual commit message parsing
- Custom version bump calculation
- Hardcoded version in Go source
- Manual release note generation
- Error-prone sed operations
- Complex multi-step workflow
```

### After (semantic-release)
```yaml
# Simple, standard workflow with ~50 lines
- Industry-standard tooling
- Automatic version determination
- Environment-based version injection
- Auto-generated changelogs
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Reliable error handling
```

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

1. **Reliability**: Battle-tested release automation
2. **Maintainability**: Significantly less custom code
3. **Standardization**: Industry-standard conventional commits
4. **Features**: Rich plugin ecosystem and better error handling
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with additional plugins
6. **Documentation**: Extensive community resources

## üß™ Testing Status

‚úÖ **Local Testing Complete**
- Go build process validated
- Version injection working correctly
- semantic-release configuration validated
- All plugins loaded successfully

Run the test script:
```bash
./scripts/test-release.sh
```

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. First Release Test
Push a commit with conventional format to trigger the new workflow:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: migrate to semantic-release for automated releases

BREAKING CHANGE: Version management is now handled by semantic-release.
Developers must use conventional commit messages for proper versioning."
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions
- Check that the new workflow runs successfully
- Verify that the binary is built with correct version info
- Confirm that GitHub release is created with proper assets

### 3. Update Team Documentation
- Share the commit message convention with the team
- Update any internal documentation referencing the old release process
- Consider adding commitlint for commit message validation

### 4. Optional Enhancements
Consider adding these plugins/features:
- `@commitlint/cli` for commit message validation
- Slack/Discord notifications for releases
- Support for pre-releases and beta channels
- Automated dependency updates

## üîß Usage for Developers

### Commit Message Format
```bash
# Patch release (0.0.1)
git commit -m "fix(cli): handle empty repository lists"

# Minor release (0.1.0)  
git commit -m "feat(pr): add support for draft pull requests"

# Major release (1.0.0)
git commit -m "feat!: remove deprecated commands"
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Test the setup
npm run release:test

# Build with custom version
VERSION=1.0.0 COMMIT=abc123 BUILD_DATE=2024-12-19 make build

# Check version
./bin/repos version
```

### Release Process
1. Develop features on feature branches
2. Create PR with conventional commit messages  
3. Merge to `main` branch
4. semantic-release automatically:
   - Analyzes commits
   - Determines version bump
   - Builds binary with version info
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Updates changelog
   - Commits changes back
